<p class="highlight"><strong>New mouse data! (June 2017)</strong><br>The attraction data is now refreshed from Horntracker more frequently. However, it's not as detailled as before, with phases, charms, etc. Also, some mice might still be missing (but will be added soon). Let me know in <a href="https://github.com/olf/mhmapsolver/issues">GitHub issues</a> how you like this.</p>
