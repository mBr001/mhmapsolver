<p class="highlight"><strong>Restore old data (09-Jun-2017)</strong><br>Thanks a lot for your feedback! As you prefer to have the phase information for the areas, I've restored the old attraction data set. I'll continue working on getting newer data with phase information. Feedback on <a href="https://github.com/olf/mhmapsolver/issues">GitHub</a> is always welcome.</p>
