<p class="highlight"><strong>News &ndash; Oct 2018:</strong> I noticed that the bookmarklet doesn't work anymore and
  would need to be changed. As I didn't maintain the solver a lot during the last months, I strongly suggest to use
  <strong><a href="https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/map.html">Tsitu's excellent alternative</a></strong>. It offers
  much more options than this one and is actively maintained.</p>
